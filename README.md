# Grundeinkommensb√ºro Backend

This is the backend for our website. The backend is based on serverless lambda functions.
It uses the Serverless Framework (https://www.serverless.com/) to define infrastructure as a code and deploy the codebase to AWS easily. Functions are bundled individally through webpack with help of the serverless-webpack package (https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack).  It uses AWS Cognito for User Authentication and DynamoDB as a non-relational database. The stack can be deployed to multiple stages. 

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies via ``npm install``
- Optionally install serverless cli (``npm install -g serverless``)

## Deployment
- Deploy the whole stack to dev: ``npm run deployDev`` or via the serverless cli ``sls deploy``
- Deploy the whole stack to prod: ``npm run deployProd`` or via the serverless cli ``sls deploy -s prod``
- Deploy one function (only via the serverless cli): ``sls deploy -f functionName -s stageName``
